      "['\"It\\'s not ok.\" I know people who have been personally affected by domestic abuse. one of my best friends now has major trust issues. children and women do NOT deserve this treatment and the only way to truly help them is to get them out of the situation and back on their feet. With the efforts to remove women and children from unsafe homes they have the chance at a new life. Ephesians 5 states \"and husbands should love their wives like that. They should love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself. \"', \"It's not ok - mistreatment or unkindness to another human being is never the right choice.\", 'The message is \"It\\'s not okay\". It is an empowering message. As a teacher I hear the response \"it\\'s okay\" to apologies all the time. One of my missions throughout every school year is to change that school of thought and empower children. For them to know \"it\\'s not okay\" that someone hurt them. For everyday classroom incidents I teach them to say \"I accept your apology\" and that \\'I\\'m sorry\\' means you won\\'t hurt me again. When you say \"it\\'s okay\" to someone who hurt you, you\\'re telling them just that. Saying \"it\\'s not okay\" EMPOWERS all people, young and old, suffering any type of abuse. #it\\'snotokay', '\"It\\'s not okay\" to stand idly by the suffering of others, or to refrain from standing up for ourselves. Abuse is a global issue that everyone is a potential victim of, and it is each individual\\'s job to make every effort to fight for those who cannot find it in themselves to fight.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" describes a feeling that anyone can possess when something occurs outside of what the individual deems acceptable and comfortable in their current situation', '\"It\\'s not okay\" - the theme this week is protecting women and children from abusers in their own homes. A home is a place where someone is supposed to feel safe and welcome, and a house with an abuser is just a war zone. Being a partner means loving unconditionally. Being a parent means loving unconditionally. It is not and will never be okay to abuse someone - especially someone you claim to love. True love conquers just about anything, but abuse is not true love. No matter what someone does, they never deserve to be abused. It\\'s not okay, it\\'s never okay. No matter what.', \"Not just women and children get abused! So do men. It may not be as common but it still happens! And it's just as bad. We can not judge and categories people because of their gender. Women are just as capable as men are. Even when it comes to abuse. #itsnotokay\", '\"It\\'s not okay\" to be a victim of domestic violence. It\\'s not okay to watch it happen and do nothing. It\\'s not okay to be the abuser. Not everyone survives domestic violence and that\\'s not okay. It\\'s not okay to cause this kind of hurt and pain to those left behind when someone doesn\\'t survive because they will never stop hurting. It\\'s just not okay. #truelife #itsnotokay #saynotodomesticviolence', '\"It\\'s not okay\" is found at the bottom of the feather. With sheepfold many women are finding rescue from abusive situations, what is heartbreaking is how difficult of a decision this can be for them. When in these relationships women can often begin to make excuses for why the abuse \"is okay\".... Whether it\\'s because they believe the me that they deserve it, that they are worthless and can\\'t find someone else, or whether they believe their partner will change.... These lies can seem like the truth and keep them in these dangerous and hurtful relationships. But it\\'s not the truth! They are worth more and deserve better.... Abuse it NOT okay. There is no reason for someone to make another feel inferior and abuse them, whether it\\'s with words or action. It\\'s not okay.', \"I am thankful that you all have commented. This means you are aware and actually care about this matter that needs more acknowledgment. The more we sit silent, there is a greater chance that someone will be violated. It's not ok as an outsider to understand abuse and not do your part. But if you are being abused or part of the situation like a child whose mother is being abused, it's ok to be scared. It's ok to not know what to do, especially because fear is a common emotion when abuse occurs. And the abuser can use it to keep the victim silent. It's terrifying to experience. And even worse is the guilt you can feel throughout your life when you do not speak up. It is ok to be scared. It's not ok to blame yourself! You should never blame yourself for the actions of someone else. It's ok to love yourself and rebuild after being abused. But it's not ok to let the abuse take over your life because you are strong. Anyone who survive abuse has a strength that is powerful and it can be used to help others heal\", '\"It\\'s not ok\" to mistreat the weak just because you are stronger. The feather represents the delicate but united with other feathers it\\'s powerful and can rise above any circumstance.', \"It's never ok to make someone feel like less to make yourself feel like more.\", '\"It\\'s not okay\" because of the theme of the week I believe the feather represents the fact that this week we are supporting the women and children in abuse situations to grow wings and \\'fly\\' in other words to help them get back on there feet and out of the situation. And of course the fact that abuse is never okay.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" these are the words that slipped out of my mouth one day. I couldn\\'t seem to forgive anymore. Having been abused by my father and stepmother, I couldn\\'t hold back the pain anymore. My CMC joint was fractured and pulled out of place. I had a cast and physical therapy. To this day, they still haven\\'t gotten into trouble for it. Of course, we reported it. I still clearly remember everything that happened that night. Being only a child, I couldn\\'t find my voice to speak up. They were calling me names and other things. An emotion unexplainable was building up inside. I wasn\\'t going to stand for being hurt and put down anymore. I did stand up for myself and I said, \" This is not okay! It\\'s not okay!\" Those words that flew off of my tongue may have given me one of the best feelings ever. They stopped then and left me alone. I knew that God was with me and I felt as if he sent an angel down to protect me that night. Today I live with my mom. To me, the feather on the shirt represents a few things. One is the way that feathers, I imagine, are on the wings of angels. The feather may have been from a guardian angel standing up for someone. Another way is that feathers are on birds that can fly. They can fly by flapping their wings. However, feathers can break free and leave behind something. I had to leave behind some things, but once I found my freedom and happiness I wasn\\'t turning back. Feathers can\\'t exactly go back to where they came from and be the same. They float in the air and sometimes stay in place. On the shirt, it is as if the feather is pausing and taking a stand against violence. Also, birds chirp and they can be heard by many people. A lot of humans listen to the songs they sing. The feather could be from a bird who sings loudly, and maybe it tries to spread the word that \"It\\'s not okay\" in its own way. Unheard abuse is the one of the worst kinds. Birds are loud and can be heard. Yet, I hope that people will one day be loud and heard. I hope that the money raised helps others to find their voices and speak up because after all, \"It\\'s not okay.\"', '\"It\\'s not okay\" to hurt anyone. Period. It\\'s not okay to take advantage of a person simply because you can. No one should suffer at the hands of another. Victims are often weaker than the ones they are being abused by and cannot fight back. No one wants to be treated this way yet it still happens and it\\'s not okay.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" is an extremely important message. It stirs up the matter that many people just sweep under the rug. Abuse in the home is something that should not at all be ignored. No child, women or even man should ever be hurt by the ones in their home. Home is where the heart is, and when you are being abused there, there is no heart at all. These people are losing their place of trust and safety. The fact that this isn\\'t recognized as much as it should be is not okay. We shouldn\\'t just listen to these peoples\\' cries and say it\\'s okay, they\\'re fine. None of this matter is okay and no person should deal with that pain. It\\'s not okay people are abused in their homes. It\\'s not okay that people are neglected by society around them. It\\'s not okay that these people lose their safe place. It\\'s not okay we don\\'t help these people when the people who would help them with problems are the problem. It\\'s not okay abuse happens. We need to stop this, because it\\'s not okay. #itsnotokay', '\"It\\'s not okay\" to attack those who are defenseless, or to stand by and watch somebody else. We have to listen to those who have no voice, defend those who cannot defend themselves, and never turn a blind eye to someone who hurts those who cannot stand up for themselves.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" to ignore domestic abuse. Everyone deserves to feel safe, protected, and loved. I think this feather represents the freedom these beautiful women and children can receive with the help of organizations such as The Sheephold.', 'Its not okay- because with the sustainablitiy of women and their children they can afford their life and not have to give in to any abusive ways of getting money or exploitation. Its not okay to take advantage of these women and their situations', '\"It\\'s not okay\"...To clip anyone\\'s wings. To cage beautiful delicate creatures who feel and think and breathe, and deserve freedom. To abuse the trust placed in you and destroy the sanctity of what familial love can be. To cast a shadow over anyone else\\'s flight, or to stop it altogether. Having grown up in a home where my father abused my mother and I, I understand better than some what it is like to live this way - and how much good a charity like this can do.', 'Featuring the phrase \"it\\'s not okay\" on this week\\'s shirt is a beautiful addition to this week\\'s cause of combating domestic violence. Why? Because domestic abuse and violence is just that - not okay. It\\'s not okay to physically or verbally abuse any fellow human being, just as it is not okay to stand idly by while it is happening. An empowering statement, \"it\\'s not okay\" reminds those who have not found it in them to leave abusive situations to try and see why they should, as well as remind those who can stand up to end it, to do so as well. And side note: beautiful as always, #teamsevenly. Thank you for all the amazing work you bring to the world.', '\"it\\'s not okay\" to abuse anyone, man, woman, or child, and no one should ever justify it. The feather represents how when victims of abuse are supported by people they love, they can rise above the abuse and soar to new things, start a new life.', 'It\\'s not okay. So many issues, including domestic violence, hunger, disease, etc. In this world go unnoticed daily. So many people are oblivious to these issues merely because they aren\\'t directly affected. However, even those who aren\\'t directly affected are indirectly touched.... When innocent people suffer in this world, when serious issues go unresolved, EVERY individual is affected. Being a bystander affects one. Letting these issues pass by without a second glance affects you, me, and every individual who has the power and reason to make a choice. These are human qualities-- the power to reason and the desire to help those in need. So, to those who have the power to choose and choose not to act; to those who have the ability to come to another aid, and walk on by without hesitating, I say \"it\\'s not okay\" we should all remember this message and use it as a reminder to change the world even a little but for the better each day.', \"It's not ok means that abuse is wrong in every situation and it's not easy to get out. But once you leave you are free and feel free. The feather symbolizes freedom and the ability to fly away from the situation.\", \"It's not okay- I believe this is a powerful and perfect addition to this weeks cause.

This is a strong message to be involved in everyone has their place in the universe no one less than the other take the symbolism and wear it proudly for everyone belongs', 'The shirt says \"it\\'s not okay\". I believe this means not only that abuse is never okay in any form, but also that it\\'s not okay to be silent when you know it\\'s happening. It\\'s not okay to allow abuse to affect the lives of women and children. I would love this shirt to help spread the message :]', '\"It\\'s not okay\" to abuse others; physically, mentally, or emotionally. Abusers do not realize the effect they have on their victims. Abuse should not be tolerated by anyone and we need to teach others that it is not ok to watch it happen to someone it not stand up for themselves. #peoplematter', \"Below the feather it says : it's not okay. When it comes to domestic abuse people tend to turn the other cheek. It's often the case that people feel it's not their place to interfere in domestic issues, but rather to leave things in the hands of the abused and abuser to continue the cycle of abuse. By failing to act as a society when domestic abuse is learned of/witnessed we are legitimizing it as a form of discipline/control within families, thus indicating that it is okay. As a result, victims and abusers are left to make excuses for themselves and to rationalize abuse as something that is okay. In order to combat the cycle of abuse the first step is enforcing the fact that it is not acceptable.\", \"It's not ok means, frankly, domestic violence isn't ok in any situation. Yes, you may love that person dearly, but if they don't want to change they're not going to. Getting out of the situation is what is important here. Once your out, the world is opened up. It's so hard to just pick up and leave someone, something, or somewhere you love, but if one of these are hurting you? Why wouldn't you leave? Because if you saw your situation from the outside, you could clearly see that it's not ok.\", 'Its no okay, those simple words stand for so much. Just imaging men, women, children go through so much everyday just to save themselfs from the harmful hand of abuse everyday. Standing in court, giving up their lives to be safe and have to defend rights that should already be defended. Its not okay to hurt ANYBODY for anymatter. Nobody deserve pain and sufferage.

I like how @essleow used the metaphor of a feather for freedom.', \"Its not okay - the littlest things we do, whether it be physical or mentally/emotional, the solution shouldn't result in abuse. The phrase is a statement, a chance to be understood and heard. Our life/voice is like a feather, soft but strong. When combined with other feathers we are able to fly and travel but when alone, its easily tossed with the wind. I believe its used for the shirt as a single feather b/c the one wearing the shirt is a single voice.

Often victims of domestics violence feel unsafe speaking out about their position, internalizing their pain with an \"its okay.\" This short, powerful statement serves to speak out for those stifled by fear and pain and advocates the fact that domestic violence is in fact NOT okay. It\\'s NOT okay to fear one\\'s own home. It\\'s NOT okay to be victimized by those who should make one feel safe. It\\'s NOT okay to turn the other cheek. \"It\\'s not okay.\"', \"#itsNotOkay EVER to abuse anyone for any reason! I was raised in an emotionally abusive home and someone close to me was sexually and physically abused by someone closest to her in the world. Abuse whether physical, emotional or sexual, is sadly mostly about power. The abuser needs to feel superior to their victim(s). There is never any excuse. I think the feather represents freedom from abuse...those who have survived and thrived in spite of being victims. They can fly as high as they want in their lives once they are able to break free of the abuse and realize it's not their fault!

Personal message and would love to rock this.', \"It's not okay. It's not okay to abuse anyone. The way some is treated depicts how they will view themselves. It's not the captain of the football team who attempts suicide, it's the kid who is daily told that they don't matter. It's not the wife who is encouraged daily that is depressed, it is the beaten wife that tries to escape their marriage. We were made to have relationships with one another; so in the core of our being we search for acceptance in others. We become vulnerable but most people take advantage of that. It's not okay.\", \"The shirt says it's not okay. This means that though you may love the person dearly, you have to show it in a different way and try to control your jealousy. When you abuse the person you love, you make them miserable, their friends worried, and their family frightened. Usually people who have been abused have been told that they are worthless and that the only person who will love them it the abuser. This is not and never will be okay. A family friend had been abused by her husband for about 10 years and no one knew until he basically almost killed her an even then she still loved him and said it was her own fault. Domestic abuse doesn't just physically harm the person; it mentally scars them and even when they leave the abuser, they have feelings of self worthlessness and they are almost always unable to be the same happy person they once were. This is why that quote is on that shirt. People need to know that abusing each other isn't normal and when it happens them, they should get out of it as soon as they can before getting sucked into the black hole of misery created for them. #peoplematter #letsallbandtogetherandfightthis\", '\"It\\'s not okay\"... So often those on the outside of abuse want to turn a blind eye or \"mind their own business\". Those who experience abuse frequently may forget that it is NOT normal or NOT okay to be mistreated. \"It\\'s not okay\" represents the concept that all living beings are deserving of love, compassion and an environment that is SAFE.', \"It's not okay to turn a blind eye on someone being bullied or hurt or anything. These people then break free and can express themselves when not judged by all the people that do that.\", '\"It\\'s not ok\" Abuse of any kind (physical, verbal, emotional) is never ok. No matter if the abuse is against a man, woman, child, or animal we must stand up and be the voice for those in need of breaking free of the terrible crime of abuse.

That is what domestic violence victims experience and it is not okay.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" against abuse, love this!', '\"Its not okay\". Its not okay to tolerate abuse, or provide it. Anyone who is abused should recognize that what their abuse is not okay. It is not okay to make anyone feel physically or mentally inferior, it is not okay to degrade anyone, abuse is not okay. If anyone is suffering from abuse, just know it is not okay! You are loved and there is a way out. Stay strong!!', '\"it\\'s not okay\" to hurt others.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" I think it shows that so many women who are abused live with the abuse because they are afraid to get help, and they don\\'t want to get in trouble or get hurt for defending themselves. Not only does it show abused people that its not okay, but it shows everyone that abuse is not ok.', \"The message is that it's not okay, referring to domestic abuse, because it's not okay. It's on a shirt this week because domestic abuse, the focus of this weeks charity, is a real problem and its often forgotten when we think of all the other problems. It needs more attention.\", \"I am so happy to see Sevenly supporting a charity that helps a charity that sadly I needed but, did not have to escape an abusive marriage. I was lucky in the fact that in 20 years of abuse, I lived through all the physical abuse. But, the emotional & mental abuse has left the deepest wounds to recover from. Now...I am trying to reach FREEDOM! It's coming in steps with a divorce but, he still tries to abuse/control me because I am financially dependent on him to provide for my two children & myself. I dream of the day the kids & I never have to see or talk to him, the day when we can be totally FREE!! Meanwhile I'm trying to start a new chapter in my life & make sure my kids can too.

They need to know it isn't okay to be treated that way.\", 'The shirt reads \"It\\'s not okay\". I believe it\\'s referring to any sort of abuse. Whether it is of children, women, men, anyone of any age deserves to be treated with love and kindness. No one should be living in fear of others, it\\'s not okay to degrade human beings! We need to bring awareness to the abuses going on in our world and bring an end to it.', \"It's not okay to be hurt by someone who loves you. Physical & verbal abuse does not equal love, it's not okay.\", 'It says, \"it\\'s not okay\". I think that the feather is a representation of the saying for multiple reasons. Mainly though it\\'s not okay to let abuse become a burden that lays on your shoulders and constantly weighs you down. Carrying abuse with you throughout life weighs you down as an individual. It doesn\\'t let you achieve your full potential and that\\'s not okay. The feather as a representation for this is telling you to be free from it. Make the struggles of abuse as light as a feather. Don\\'t let it burden you. Be free and travel the winds of life with all of its opportunities that it gives to you.', '\"Its not okay\". Its not okay to put aside other people and pretend they dont exist every single one of us is here for a reason and we should all respect each other and respect the beauty of life. Namaste.', \"It's not ok. Don't tolerate abuse. Use your wings and fly away\", '\"It is not okay\" that anyone suffers from any kind of abuse anywhere, especially in their homes.

It\\'s not okay, means those in abusive relationships need to recognize that they do not and should not tolerate abuse. As a victim of abuse I am here to tell you that although I was aware \"it wasn\\'t okay \" I was scared. I was scared to be on my own, to be alone, but I did it and now I truly try to help those in similar situations so that they may realize. It\\'s Not Okay and there is help out there.', \"The feather represents flight. A flight to a better future. I'm sure we have all been in situations where we wish we could fly away to a better place a better situation.

You deserve to be set free from the abusive chains that bind you down. Abuse will never be okay.', 'The message is \"it\\'s not okay\" for women and children to be domestically abused. It happens, if I remember what the site said correctly, every 15 seconds. So, to be abused by the person you thought you were most safe with, in your safe place, and possibly with your children is not okay. Nobody deserves to be treated like they aren\\'t worth the world, because they really are precious. The feather is symbolic of starting new and fresh. Birds lose feathers all the time, but it doesn\\'t stop them from flying. Instead, they keep going and leave the feather as a beautiful reminder they were here. So to me, the feather is showing the strength in the victims and that it is possible to still live a life free from all those bad experiences, and fly away to pursue the life they deserve. In the process this will give way to more victims following those same footsteps, and being free. It\\'s almost like leaving behind feathers as a way to say \"I was here\"', \"It's not okay for you to believe that you are anything less than beautiful and anything less than deserving of every wonderful thing this world has to offer.\", 'The phrase \"It\\'s Not Okay\" is printed at the bottom of the shirt. The phrase is used as a sort of fighting mantra for those seeking to end the evils of abuse as we believe that such acts are never warranted nor should they be tolerated. The purpose of the shirt is to help provide freedom for those encapsulated by the grasps of abuse and to proclaim to the masses that no, abuse is not okay.', '\"It\\'s not okay\". It\\'s not okay to abuse love and emotions to deny your issues, addictions, and hate. To value a human so little that it makes you feel better. Love is supposed to make you feel free with your imperfections not used to devalue. Violence ends when we defend the defenseless and empower those through self love.', 'It says \"It\\'s Not Okay\". This means that domestic violence of any kind or degree is absolutely unacceptable and most certainly \"Not Okay\".

Domestic Violence is \"Not Okay,\" and that\\'s all there is to it.', \"It's not okay because people matter, no matter the age of the gender of the people they matter, abuse is NEVER ok. It's not okay because it destroys the person and instead of making them feel love it causes them to have to learn to fear and or fight, it changes their worlds and makes them a dark place. No one should have to know that kind of darkness. It's not okay because people were never meant to be punching bags they were meant for love.\", '\"It\\'s not okay.\" It\\'s not okay to go through life with negative emotions or regret weighing you down. Life is such a beautiful gift and you should wake up each morning with a gracious heart. Float through life, light as a feather! You only get to do it once.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" means that even when things seem to be going perfectly in someone\\'s life, they don\\'t have it all together. Because it\\'s so common for people to say that they\\'re \"okay\" even when there not, portraying the realness of what\\'s happening in your life, admitting that you\\'re not okay, is a step in the right direction.', 'The phrase is \"It\\'s not okay.\" I believe it applies to domestic violence, but also to knowing about it and doing nothing. The abuse will continue until someone stands up for the women and children being abused. Sometimes they\\'re not able to stand up for themselves, so we have to stand up for them. We have to stand up and say \"It\\'s not okay.\" Women and children in those situations need to know that \"It\\'s not okay.\" We have to be the ones to tell them that.', 'The message is \"It\\'s not okay\" and I believe it represents the effort to make a stand that domestic abuse is not alright in any manner, no matter what. Life is precious and beautiful and to be treasured, just as that of the gorgeous feather depicted on this week\\'s shirts. Abuse takes place so often and likely with people we\\'re meant to trust, look up to, admire and even love. They take away that faith that has been put in them and replace it with hurt, shame, guilt, sadness, anger and fear. It\\'s not a joke, it\\'s not ever something to be made light of, and it\\'s something that needs a lot more attention in a positive way so that those who are victims feel strong enough to heal and stand proud as survivors. Beautiful people, you are never alone and always enough, your abuser cannot take your inner sparkle.', 'It\\'s not okay-because it\\'s not! We are so trained to just say \"it\\'s okay\" but working at a domestic violence shelter myself-my main job is to let women know \"it\\'s not okay\" what has happened to them and how they were treated.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" - it is never okay to hurt another living being emotionally, physically or intellectually.

Abuse is not okay. Letting abuse continue is not okay.', '\"It\\'s not ok\" because harming someone who can defend themselves is wrong enough but harming defenseless children is truly disgusting, disgraceful and heinous.

The message \"It\\'s not okay\" on this week\\'s cause shirts reminds us that we need to stand for what is right and stand against what is wrong. Abuse is a cruel, unjust, barbaric evil that no one should have to endure. But if those who have a voice do not rise to say \"It\\'s not ok\", do not rise to defend the defenseless, then evil will triumph. This week\\'s campaign reminds us to be the good in the world and to stand up against the evil that pervades our world.

The courage it takes to leave is unimaginable. But once they\\'re out they are free. Feathers represent freedom, peace, and joy. All things these women eventually find, just like feathers. We find feathers on the path of life as reminders that a bird was there. Just like these women will find reminders of the past but they now have wings that still allow them to fly even when they lose one.', '\"It\\'s not okay\". That being domestically abused by anyone at any degree is just ok and normal. That there are people who has convinced themselves to say that it is ok. And the phrase is blunt and it goes straight to the point no questions asked.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" is a statement that gives the power back to those who have been abused. Having the strength to be honest and brave enough to realize that their unjust treatment is not okay is the first step. This statement lets them know that they are not alone, and there is someone out there to help them ascend from the darkness and start anew, living the life they were meant to. The use of the white feather is a beautiful symbol that touches every aspect of these situations - cowardice on the part of the abusers, pacifism on part of the outsiders, and hope and freedom for the victims.', \"It's not okay- because exactly that. It's not. It's not okay for human beings to do this to one another, but not only that it's not okay for us to believe that we deserve it, to judge one another for what they may be going through and most definitely not okay for women to be abused. Such a simple statement with such strong meaning\", 'The beauty behind the words \"it\\'s not okay\" is that it stands for so much. It\\'s not okay to abuse someone mentally or physically. It\\'s not okay to stand by and watch abuse take place. It\\'s not okay to let yourself become the abused because you think you deserve it. If every 15 seconds someone is being abused then something is wrong. People need to stand up for what they believe and know is right; it\\'s not okay to abuse any person of any age, gender, or race. We are not called to sit here and watch lives be taken away - both in the metaphorical and literal sense - we are called to do something about it. We must stand up and declare that it is not okay to abuse one another! We do not and will not tolerate the abuse, and will not be a bystander allowing the cycle of abuse to continue. Let our voices be heard even when we do not speak, because when we wear this shirt we display a message for all - a warning to the abusers that what they have done or are doing is not okay, and reminding those who are or have fallen victim to violence that what happened to them was not okay and that they are strong beautiful beings. Domestic violence is not okay.', '\"it\\'s not ok\" I work with youth and this semester we were talking about domestic violence and what it looks like. There are a whole lot of stereotypes and lies that are believed, like a real man can\\'t be a victim of domestic violence, which simply aren\\'t true, but keep people from speaking up and getting help. \"it\\'s not ok\" speaks to that very point.

A feather is symbolized usually in something light. Its shown in videos or things that the feather falls and lightly flips or turns as it is falling.

When they feather finnaly lands it can be an example of death; showing all of your problems you faced till the end. Also a feather is sometimes picked up again by wind or another force, showing that there was a time in your life you went through a going amount of obstacles. Once you, the feather, have hit the ground it can show you have a moment of peace remaining still. But the reason the feather can be interperated into the saying of \"Be Still\" is that your going to go through flips and turns in your life but if you are \"still\" things might go another way. \"Be Still\" is a quote from the bible if you have a christian faith. Exodus 14:14; The lord is fighting for you! Be still. Even if you are not a person of faith it, the feather can be showing that \"The Lord\" or someone you look up for as a mayjor guidence is fighting for you, the feather.

The feather is a reminder to let go of those things that no longer serve us.', 'I think \"it\\'s not okay\" is an empowering statement for someone being abused. It\\'s not okay for it to happen, under any circumstances.', 'The statement reads: \"It\\'s not okay\", and domestic abuse is never ok. I think the feather represents life, and how fragile our lives are. We need to make sure to stand together and be strong in the face of abuse.', 'We all think it\\'s okay if \"she\" says it\\'s okay. Don\\'t get it twisted. Lots of women in the cycle decide to stay in the cycle. Lots of women need our help. It\\'s okay to let them decipher.', 'This week\\'s shirt pictures a beautiful feather with the message: \"It\\'s not Okay\" and this message is to help mothers and their children realize they can be free of their abusers! I believe it\\'s on a shirt this week because just like the mothers and their children of abusers, sometimes this issue is hidden in the shadows and rarely comes to light. I\\'m so happy to see that there is help and awareness being offered for such a common yet not touched upon enough tragedy. And for this cause and seeing this shirt design I was inspired to write this poem: \"It\\'s not okay to treat us this wayIt\\'s not okay to endure this hurt each dayWith a symbol of hope we can make it throughWe can get through it all, and survive without youA feather to help us fly awayA feather to carry us to a new dayA day without fear, pain, and sorrowA feather to ensure we soar to a brighter tomorrow\" ~ Lindsay CortezAnd just like this amazing shirt, I hope this poem can also aid to inspire those that need help seeing that there is a way out, and that abuse is Never Okay!', \"It's not okay. It's not okay for anyone to suffer at the hands of another person. It's not okay for anyone to turn a blind eye to the suffering of the defenseless. It's never okay.\", '@kayyceebabee thought of u when I saw the feather!!', \"It's not okay. Domestic abuse is not okay. It's not okay to live in fear, because in reality, that's not living. Abuse is a big deal, but so often, we try to hide it, and it weighs you down, and eats you up inside. It makes you feel alone, and often causes you to blame yourself, and we are not meant to live that way! Saying it's not okay is a huge step. It's moving towards healing, and it shows immense strength and courage! It's exciting!\", 'The line goes \"It\\'s not Okay\". To me, that embraces the idea that we\\'ve grown accustomed to things just being the way they\\'ve always been and society just have to learn to manage it. However, some things are \"not Okay\" and we know it, and by saying it it\\'s the first step to trigger a change and help those in need and bring equality and stability.', 'IT IS NOT OKAY to let mothers and their children be victims of domestic abuse and through the hope of sevenly and supporters they will and can live freely and independently from their abuser.', '@dumbofan this is adoribs', '\"It\\'s not okay\" to allow those we love, or even those we don\\'t know, to make excuses for being treated poorly. \"It\\'s not okay\" to turn a blind eye and pretend it doesn\\'t exist. We must come together as prayer warriors and be strong for the families that need us. It is okay to do as much as we possibly can go help them.', 'The line says \"it\\'s not okay\" and the message is very simple: it is not okay to hurt another human being. Families are supposed to be places of love and it is not okay for people to turn them into abusive situations.', '@unordinary19 This might be one you like', 'Yeah just saw this one @missyb47', 'Cooles Design! :)', \"It says it's not okay. These simple words are so hard to understand in an abusive situation because you're made to believe you deserve the abuse. This is a powerful message, and a cause that needs so much support.\", 'It says it\\'s not okay. This means it is not okay to hurt anyone in anyway, and that needs to be spread. It is our job to do something about abuse, and child protection. As another shirt says it is our job to \"defend the defenseless\". We can\\'t go on thinking that it\\'s okay, or ignoring it. People need to start making a change towards protecting people from abuse, when they can\\'t protect themselves or see a light at the end of the tunnel.', \"It's shows imperfection. Which is perfectly imperfect. Just like people we all have our flaws. People should stop judging others. It's our character that counts\", \"It's not okay is reassuring to a female that they shouldn't be putting up with any type of abuse from a boyfriend.. A lot of women question themselves after going through abuse and need to be reminded that it's not their fault and what the abuser is doing is not okay.\", 'It is not okay. It shows that you need to stand up for yourself and fight for your own freedom. You cannot just say that \"you\\'re okay\" when you\\'re not. It is not okay for the people you love to emotionally or physically hurt you.', \"It's not okay. It's not okay to hurt anyone in any way, shape or form. Plain and simple. It is our job to stop this verbal, physical, & mental abuse. No matter if a person has a mental or physical disability, if they talk or act different than you...no matter what it is not okay to make someone feel as if they are less. In the end, we will not be judged on how we look, or our disabilities, but on how we treated others.\", \"It's not okay. Plain and simple, people matter... looking after human-kind is our top priority....unconditional love!!!\", \"It's not okay. when someone asks you, you always answer it's okay anyway, no matter if it is okay or not. Og could be about anything, doesn't have to be about you, or your friend. But you never say that it is not okay. Here you can say it with your shirt; it isn't okay and you can see it without asking.\", \"It's not okay.\", \"It's not okay just because they're your parents. Abuse comes in all shapes and forms, especially from people you'd never expect. It's NOT OKAY for someone else to tell you your worthless, no matter how much they're worth to you.\", 'It took me a long time to figure that fact out myself...', \"It's not okay.\", '@mallory_gigl you need this shirt.', '\"It\\'s not okay\" means that abuse of anything or anyone is not okay. No one should be belittled or hurt by anyone else.', \"It's not ok... Referring to domestic abuse... #pickmepickme #iwannawin #ilovesevenly\", 'Domestic violence happens regardless of era, regardless of culture and in every society around the globe. \"It\\'s not okay\" tells the world that this norm isn\\'t okay and that we will not tolerate it any longer. The feather stands for the strength to find freedom that these women need to have when leaving an abusive situation.', '\"Its not okay\"-women fall in love. They love their daddies as children, even if abusive, and grow to love the abusers they now are attached to. They give the excuse \"its okay\" when hurt because abuse is a cycle. They accept this belief over time because its what they\\'ve come to know. As a victim, It becomes normal. \"Its not okay\" shouts to them that this ISN\\'T okay...and isn\\'t normal. It shows them the support and love they need to become free from this horrible situation. Wearing this feather shows them that we support them sprouting their wings and flying into freedom, away from the hurt and the cycle of abuse. Its not okay, its not. And we won\\'t stand for it. I love this cause. Abuse is mental, physical, sexual....it comes in many forms and it isn\\'t okay. Ever. @sevenly', \"I'm in love with this and everything feathers stand for! It's not okay... Meaning violence is not ok. Any sort, but for this campaign, domestic violence. It's never ok, regardless of age/gender to harm another person physically or mentally. I got a feather tattoo because I believe deeply in everyone's right to #freedom #strength #spirituality and #safety. I love the representation of flight, courage, free-spiritedness, honor, celestial wisdom, faith, hope and charity! Which all people should have.\", \"It's not okay....ever. It's not okay to use your strength to cause harm. It's not okay to use your words to cause harm. It's not okay to demean, abuse, control, or do anything that treats another person with anything less than dignity and respect. As a social worker, one of my proudest moments was assisting a woman escape from an abusive relationship. She started over, went to college, and now has not just a career but a sense of self-worth that is priceless. NO ONE can ever take that away from her. #lovewins\", '\"It\\'s not okay\" @sevenly such a simple phrase with such a complicated meaning. We are taught to let things go, not take offence, and to move on when others do or say hateful things. And it\\'s great to be able to turn the other cheek but wouldn\\'t be easier if we didn\\'t have to? By making it socially aware that certain things are not acceptable like bullying and abuse so many people would lead better lives. Bullying and abuse lead to so many bad things and it should never be okay by any means. Love the tshirt, love the message #itsnotokay :)', '@gabrielabonilla biatch! lol', \"It's not ok. A simple phrase packed will deep and complex meanings that may very from person to person. It's not ok to treat someone as you would not want to be treated. It's not ok to treat someone as if they are not invaluable. It's not ok to mentally, physically, or sexually abuse an individual for any reason because all people matter. We are all here on this planet for a purpose. We are all born with something special inside of us and it's not okay to use hurtful words and violence to make someone feel anything less than special. It is our duty as people to treat other people as we wish to be treated and that is nothing less than the best, with unconditional love, kindness, and support. @sevenly\", '@thetaoofme_2 You are the winner!

That it is a sin against Jesus and God. Well guess what? That is a sin in itself. It\\'s a lie. If Jesus were alive, he would love gays just like he loves straight people, just like he loves any human of any color and religion. He preached love and acceptance.

Homosexuality isn't something a person seeks or wants--it is already bedded deep inside them, on a chromosomal level. It is biology, my friend. It is part of who the person is, just like heterosexuality is chromosomal and part of who a person is. I never asked to be straight. I never seeked or wanted to be straight. I was made like this.

Doesnt matter what but if you comment hate or unacceptance, I will block you.', 'Well said @howimetyourmother_official', '@howimetyourmother_official i love you hahaha good points!!', 'Well said, I completely agree with you! @howimetyourmother_official', '@howimetyourmother_official im not trying to be mean ir hate or anything, but who are you to say that Jesus was gay?', \"@adam_the_hill Who are people to say Jesus was white? He wasn't. He was from Palestine (which was there before modern Israel). Have you seen the people there? They are dark skinned. Who are people to say God is a white male? He may he a she. He/she may be black, Asian, Latino, etc. @howimetyourmother_official has every right to express an opinion when she has been educated in the subject and can say something without being ignorant of it. He really could've been gay for all we know.\", '@isabelmonca yes. he was dark skinned. Thankyou for reminding everybody. But I wasnt speaking about the colour of his skin was I? The point im trying to get across is that she has no right to say shes sure he was gay. She might think he was gay, and she can say that, but she has no right to say shes sure shes gay. And actually, you dont know that im not educated in this stuff, so learn your facts before you say something, yeah?', \"@adam_the_hill I never said you weren't educated...what I said is valid, and yes what you say is valid, as well as what she said is valid. I bet you there have been books written about Jesus being gay. However, he has been dead for thousands of years, so there is no way to truly tell since we cannot ask him :P\", \"@howimetyourmother_official With all due respect, it's kind of ironic that you said you will block people who comment unacceptance. I support homosexual rights, but I only stick up for gay people when people say something rude about them. In my opinion, theres nothing wrong with disagreeing with their lifestyle, but don't say mean & hurtful things towards homosexuals.\", 'That being said, I saw some people arguing about how being gay is \"unnatural\" and I think that\\'s a ridiculous argument. If we got rid of everything that we didn\\'t deem \"natural\" we wouldn\\'t have cars, tv\\'s, phones, microwaves, paper, and a wackload of other stuff. Humans like things that aren\\'t \"natural.\" We like to build things, invent things, and try new things.', \"even if@you don't agree with it they should still have rights. It's about the law not religion. Years ago woman and black people didn't have rights and they do now. It's all the same\", \"@aables182 you just compared marriage to the right to vote. No they aren't the same, government should have no place in marriage anway.\", \"@iship_ Okay, so I guess I can expect you to never shave, never cut your hair, never get divorced, never get a piercing, never fix your teeth, never get tattoos, never treat a women as an equal level with you, never let your woman get a job nor vote or voice any opinion over your own, never wear clothing that have mixed fabrics, never eat any fruits/vegetables ever because they were planted beside each other, never masturbate, and never have sex unless with the intention of having kids. Alright, you said it yourself that you can't go against what it says. Then don't. You now have to live under those rules because if you break them, it's a sin. And according to your bible, every sin is the same. So you wearing a mixed fabric shirt is the same as someone being gay. Have fun living an narrow-minded life. You're not educated /on the subject/. A simple google search of the official APA on homosexuality and it will explain logically how there is nothing wrong with it. That's from professional researchers on the subject, they can have no bias on the subject otherwise their research is thrown out the window.\", \"The bible says that as long as they don't have sex they have not sinned, so they just need to be abstinent\"]\n",

People like you need to stop living in the 1800s and start focusing on more important things than a cop who shot an African American boy while being assaulted by him, as tragic as it is. You can't just use excuses and play the race card your whole life, you have to take responsibilty and learn to grow the fuck up.\", '@calebb____ hahaha oh thank you for life suggestion.', \"@niambiiiii I never called black people heaps of garbage. I'm referring to ALL lazy liberals as heaps of worthless garbage because they do nothing but let the government care for them. You misquoted me and you're throwing straw man arguments around to make it seem like I said something racist. If anyone's racist, it's you because you assumed that I was referring to only black people. You assumed that I meant only black people receive government assistance when clearly I didn't. You also assume that only black people are liberals, and you assume only black people support Trayvon Martin. Have a good day.\", '@calebb____ If you were in fact referring to \"liberals\", I would really suggest you learn how to phrase an argument sensibly. Saying something like that in a thread in which race is heavily discussed is senseless.

Also, explain how that would make me \"racist\", as opposed to misinformed or simply ignorant. I think that\\'s an extreme jump. Or really, just incorrect. But otherwise, you\\'re completely right, I shouldn\\'t have assumed at all. Under this context, however, your statement was pretty damning.', \"@movaround No, you're right. Anyone living in America who does not think there is still prejudice and racial bias is living in another realm. Reality is where these things are happening. To be honest, it's hard for people of color to not play the race card, because America refuses to get the fuck over the race card. Minorities constantly have to prove themselves /worthy/ of being accepted into the mainstream. It's only been about 60 years since we've even gotten any rights at all. People still remember being oppressed. Anyone who thinks America can revert itself from hundreds of years of racism and bigotry in 60 is delusional, and it's sad that nobody ever wants to deal with what is really happening.\", \"@niambiiiii The abolishing of slavery didn't happen because people cared, mind you. It didn't happen because attitudes changed. It was politics, that. is. all. And that's all it ever is.\", '@niambiiiii Clearly you aren\\'t racist towards African Americans, as anyone could see. That\\'s just my more entertaining way of making you rethink your argument that I was referring to only black people. As for rewording my comment to better emphasize what group of people is the subject of my earlier statement, you\\'re right. I should be more careful on posts like these. Under your context, however, I might think that you hate white people. I think it\\'s possible that you don\\'t generally like white people, but you don\\'t see me jumping to conclusions, do you?
